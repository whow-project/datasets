# Data and Transformations

This repository includes some datasets we are currently working on and transformations we apply to them.
In particular the transformations are: 1) Python scripts to carry out data cleansing activities; 2) RML rules for transforming typically tabular data into RDF-based datasets forming the WHOW knowledge graph.
